      <description>Addressed to Federal Government, Provincial Governments, Canadaâ€™s Research Funding Councils, and University senior administrators:
The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to graduate students across the country. We recognize the steps taken by both the federal and provincial governments, and post-secondary institutions, to protect not just graduate students, but all students, faculty, and staff. These measures include the six-month suspension of student loan repayment and the expansion of the Canada Summer Jobs program.</description>
