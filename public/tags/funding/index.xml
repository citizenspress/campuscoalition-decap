      <description>An overview of Ontario government&amp;rsquo;s cuts to higher education and the attempted bankrupting of democratic student organizations.
More information pages from our coalition partners available here.
Summary Unfunded 10% Tuition Fee Reduction will result in an approximate 4% cut to university budgets. Universities will be under pressure to outsource, cut services, increase precarious employment, and/or lay-off staff.
Regressive OSAP changes will result in massive increased student debt and increased burden for mature students.</description>

Unfortunately, decades of government funding shortfalls have created barriers to accessing education. Ontario students pay some of the highest tuition fees in the country and graduate with an average $28,000 in debt.
