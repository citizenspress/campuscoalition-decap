			<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Students and workers are appalled by the Doug Ford government’s
shameful attempt to use a tuition fee reduction as a political
gimmick to try and hide a $600 million cut to student grants, a $440
million cut to university and college budgets, all and a petty and
vindictive attack on democratic students’ unions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ontario’s faculty, staff, and students are united in our opposition
to these cuts and attacks, which threaten education quality,
accessibility, and student life on campus.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tuition-fee-reductions">Tuition fee reductions</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We are in favour of making postsecondary education more accessible
and has long advocated for tuition fee reductions, but not in the
absence of increased core funding and sound student financial
aid policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without increased public funding for Ontario’s universities and
colleges, the Ford Government’s announced tuition fee reduction is
nothing more than a $440 million cut to the province’s already
under-funded universities and colleges. This cut follows a decade of
eroding funding for postsecondary education in Ontario</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite these reductions, most students will find themselves deeper
in debt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is important to note that Minister Fullerton signaled the
government’s commitment to not cut core operating grants for
postsecondary institutions, but these ill-conceived tuition fee
reductions will shrink university budgets, increase class sizes,
encourage further tuition fee hikes for international students, and
threaten both the accessibility and quality of postsecondary
education in Ontario.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>International students, who pay the highest tuition fees in Ontario
($34,961 per year on average at the undergraduate level), are
ineligible for this 10 per cent reduction in tuition fees.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="osap-cuts">OSAP cuts</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The announced OSAP cuts and changes to eligibility criteria mean it
will be harder for many students to access postsecondary education.
The $600 million cut to student grants will result in thousands of
students being forced to take out expensive loans and graduate with
even more debt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While the government may try to use the misleading and inaccurate
Auditor General’s report for political cover, there is no good
argument to be made for rolling back OSAP. Given the data available,
it was an effective and popular program desperately needed by
Ontario students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have real concerns with the Auditor General’s Report. It’s clear
that most of the money in the existing program was reallocated from
less effective financial assistance programs. The Auditor General’s
claim that it is unsustainable is misleading.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like a lot of Ford’s spin, this is a manufactured crisis being used
to attack Ontario’s most vulnerable. This is a regressive policy
that will force students from low-income families to pay more for
their education.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="attacks-on-students">Attacks on students</h2>
<h3 id="ancillary-fees">Ancillary fees</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ancillary fees are those fees that &ldquo;support services and activities
distinct from academic programming or general overhead for
the institution. Examples of ancillary fees include convocation
fees, student activity fees, athletic fees, health care and
insurance fees, field trip fees and fees associated with the cost of
buildings such as student centres.” Also, certain technology fees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is how the fee is set that matters, not what it pays for. When
students vote to create a fee to fund a service through a referenda,
they are expressing their democratic will. Any attempt by the
government or institution to make these fee voluntary is an attack
on democracy and students&rsquo; rights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These fees can be implemented in a few different ways, but it is
important to distinguish between those fees that are set by a
university or college administration and those fees that are set by
students in democratic referenda.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="student-dues">Student Dues</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Students’ unions are distinct and independent
democratic organizations. Students’ unions are formed and their dues
are set by democratic referenda. Rather than paying for a specific
non-academic activity or service, students’ union membership dues
maintain the independent democratically elected and run students’
unions that represent students on university, college and government
committees, advocate on behalf students, and provide
cost-saving services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students’ unions are democratically run not-for-profits founded by
and for students and should be free from government interference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dues that students’ unions collect and how those dues are spent
are determined by students through annual elections, referenda, and
membership meetings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making these dues optional would fundamentally undermine the rights
of students and their ability to collectively organize and advocate
as a group. It is a cynical attack on students’ rights that assumes
that students are not able to make democratic decisions
for themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Through their advocacy work, students’ play an important role
holding universities and governments accountable for decisions about
issues including tuition fees and student financial assistance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The government’s unnecessary and anti-democratic decision to make
many student fees voluntary is not about choice. It is a deliberate
effort to undermine students’ rights and dismantle democratic
students’ unions. This is a petty and vindictive government driven
by a desire to silence opposing voices, especially on university and
college campuses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is no coincidence that this government is cutting support for
students’ unions at the same time they are cutting OSAP and
university and college budgets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite this government’s claim to care about “free speech”, this is
a deliberate attempt to stifle political debate, dissent, and
student speech on campus. It will defund the students’ unions and
student media that work to hold the government to account on
postsecondary education issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The average students’ union dues are roughly only $100 and the
services they provide are essential, including campus food banks,
women’s centres, pride centres, Indigenous services centres, mental
health support centres, sexual assault support centres, subsidized
transit passes, non-profit health and dental plans, academic support
and advocate services (such as challenging academic misconduct
decisions and representing students on tribunals), funding for
campus clubs and societies, funding for student refugees, collecting
levies for independent campus press, and operating affordable
non-profit commercial services such as book stores, restaurants
and cafes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every student pays dues that support these services, every student
has access to all of these services, but only those students who
need support use these services. That is how it should be. Students
have decided to democratically work together to fund a students’
union that can represent, advocate, and provide services for the
collective good of all students.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students’ union provide good jobs for thousands of students
across Ontario.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making students’ union fees optional will irrevocably harm student
life on campus and eliminate many of the services students
depend on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fee-bureaucracy-and-democracy">Fee Bureaucracy and Democracy</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Making these fees optional will substantially increase
costs and red tape for university and college administration as they
struggle to absorb essential services defunded by this government.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At every level of government, elected leaders sometimes do things
they should not. In response, we don’t abolish or defund the
government or the democratic structures that support it, we hold our
elected representatives to account and make sure that, as a society
or as a union or as a students’ union, we have laws and regulations
in place to prevent these incidents.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="consultation">Consultation</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is shocking that the government would make an announcement of
this magnitude without consulting any stakeholders at the province’s
postsecondary institutions, including students, faculty, staff, or
even university and college administrations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In fact, despite the fact that postsecondary stakeholder groups,
including students, faculty, and staff, have repeatedly requested
meeting with this Minister of Training, Colleges, and Universities
Merillee Fullerton, the Minister has chosen to ignore or deny
those requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This complete lack of consultation, transparency, and accountability
demonstrates that Doug Ford’s government does not represent—nor does
it care for—the interests of the students, faculty, or staff at
Ontario’s universities and colleges.</p>
</li>
</ul>
