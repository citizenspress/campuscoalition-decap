      <description>WHO&amp;rsquo;S CAMPUS? OUR CAMPUS!
This past January, the Ontario government announced changes to post-secondary education that will cut OSAP and de-fund our democratically chosen student groups, dramatically affect students and their access to education. Across Ontario, students are gearing up for a Provincial Day of Action with the Canadian Federation of Students! Join your CSA as thousands of students walk out of classes and protest the changes to OSAP and the Student Choice Initiative.</description>
