We would like to invite you to attend our planning meeting for the We are the Students campaign. You may have heard that earlier this year the Ford government announced sweeping changes to post-secondary education. Our movement, built by students, workers, and community members are concerned with the changes made to OSAP, funding for post-seconday education, and the attacks on student organizing.</description>
