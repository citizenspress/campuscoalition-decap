      <description>Join an action in a community near you June 7 marks one year of resisting government cuts to public services, education, health care and decent work.
We will be hitting the streets across Ontario to show that we didn&amp;rsquo;t vote for that.
Actions are being organized right now for EITHER June 7 or June 8. RSVP here and we will send you details of the actions in your area for you to take part.</description>
