      <description>On March 20, 2019 Students of OCAD University will be walking out of class at 12:00pm to send a clear message to the Ford Government that NO DECISIONS are to be made without the consultation of the students. We will not accept this attack on post-secondary education, OSAP and student democracy. We will walk out of 100 McCaul and organize at a near location for a student town hall where we will be discussing the detrimental reforms the government is proposing.</description>
