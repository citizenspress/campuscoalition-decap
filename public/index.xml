      <description>An overview of Ontario government&amp;rsquo;s cuts to higher education and the attempted bankrupting of democratic student organizations.
More information pages from our coalition partners available here.
Summary Unfunded 10% Tuition Fee Reduction will result in an approximate 4% cut to university budgets. Universities will be under pressure to outsource, cut services, increase precarious employment, and/or lay-off staff.
Regressive OSAP changes will result in massive increased student debt and increased burden for mature students.</description>

      <description>Overview Students and workers are appalled by the Doug Ford government’s shameful attempt to use a tuition fee reduction as a political gimmick to try and hide a $600 million cut to student grants, a $440 million cut to university and college budgets, all and a petty and vindictive attack on democratic students’ unions.
Ontario’s faculty, staff, and students are united in our opposition to these cuts and attacks, which threaten education quality, accessibility, and student life on campus.</description>

      <title>Ontario university and college faculty, staff, and students give Ford government failing grade on plans for postsecondary education</title>

      <description>The Ford government recently announced its plans to steamroll ahead with a reckless “performance” based funding plan. Postsecondary faculty, academic librarians, staff, and students are opposed to this flawed funding experiment and give the government a failing grade for its approach.
The government, which already provides the lowest postsecondary per-student funding in Canada, has now announced that it will allow per-student funding to drop by more than 10 per cent. This negligence will starve Ontario universities and colleges of vital resources required to ensure students receive a high-quality education.</description>

      <title>End Contracting Out at University of Toronto</title>

      <description>End Contracting Out
Update On August 17th, 2020 the University of Toronto initiated a new contracting out plan by privatizing a significant portion of caretaking services. The University removed and transferred CUPE 3261 caretakers from 18 buildings at the St. George Campus, replacing them with two private companies to provide cleaning services. These companies employ low-paid workers with little to no benefits.
As a &amp;ldquo;Top 10&amp;rdquo; Employer and a premier public institution, most would expect U of T to provide good job opportunities alongside high-quality cleaning services, especially during COVID-19.</description>

      <description>The Canadian Federation of Students&amp;ndash;Ontario has launched a campaign called Education for All.
Access to post secondary education is a critical part of responding to the COVID-19 crisis and ensuring a successful social and economic recovery. Unfortunately, decades of government funding shortfalls have created barriers to accessing education. Ontario students pay some of the highest tuition fees in the country and graduate with an average $28,000 in debt.

      <title>New OSAP “information module” does nothing to address financial barriers to post-secondary education | CFS Ontario</title>
      <link>https://campuscoalition.org/post/osapmodule/</link>

      <description>Originally published by the CFS Ontario
Ontario Student Assistance Program (OSAP) applications for the 2020-2021 academic year opened on May 20. The application now requires students to complete a mandatory “information module” that purports to highlight financial literacy. Students are disappointed in this addition to the OSAP application process, which is both patronizing and does not address the true financial barriers to post-secondary education.
“Students face barriers repaying student debt because of the high cost of education, not because of a lack of financial literacy,” said Kayla Weiler, Ontario Representative of the Canadian Federation of Students, “what students really need is more grants instead of loans, and greater public investment into post-secondary education to reduce and ultimately eliminate tuition fees.</description>

      <description>Addressed to Federal Government, Provincial Governments, Canada’s Research Funding Councils, and University senior administrators:
The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented challenges to graduate students across the country. We recognize the steps taken by both the federal and provincial governments, and post-secondary institutions, to protect not just graduate students, but all students, faculty, and staff. These measures include the six-month suspension of student loan repayment and the expansion of the Canada Summer Jobs program.</description>

      <description>Students’ unions, founded by and for students, are fully autonomous organizations governed by democratically elected boards and executives. They are membership-driven organizations funded by their members through dues.
University administrations do not have the authority and cannot justify violating the legal autonomy of students’ unions or any other campus unions.
Regardless of their motives for doing so, university administrations have no right to:
withhold students’ union membership dues; interfere in students’ union elections or operations; or attempt to shut down students’ unions (or any other legally autonomous organization).</description>

      <description>The Ford government has introduced legislation to cap increases in total compensation at an average (benefits and wages) of 1% per year for all public sector employees, including university and college workers. The legislation will affect all collective agreements on expiry and last three years. Current bargaining will continue, but while the bill has not passed yet, it&amp;rsquo;s current language says it will apply retroactively to June 5, 2019.
Government attack on workers’ rights will deny fair wages and benefits to contract faculty and already underpaid academic staff | OCUFA Ontario faculty are deeply concerned by the Ford government’s attempt to cap public sector compensation increases at one per cent per year.</description>

      <description>How Ryerson students will be impacted On January 17th, the provincial government announced sweeping rollbacks to the Ontario Student Assistance Program (OSAP), funding for Ontario colleges and universities and dramatically altering how student fees are administered.
The provincial government has announced a 10 per cent cut to tuition fees for domestic students across all programs, which will adversely affect each institutions’ funding. The government has also rolled back OSAP regulations to their 2016 form, which will result in a reduction in non-repayable grants and an increase in student loans and, therefore, the amount of student debt, while also proposing to remove the 6-month grace period for charging interest on student loans.</description>

International students, who pay the highest tuition fees, are ineligible for a 10% reduction in tuition fees. Universities and colleges will face funding cuts of up to $440 million which impact the quality of education in the province. These deep cuts are expected to be downloaded onto students and workers through larger class sizes, fewer course options and cuts to wages and benefits.</description>

      <description>Ontario’s universities and colleges are vital spaces where a culture of rich academic debate and free expression should be fostered. Core to the mandate of our postsecondary institutions is the advancement of knowledge, and that requires our campuses to be places where all community members have the right to speak their minds and respectfully challenge each other intellectually. Faculty associations, labour unions, and student unions deeply believe in these rights, and will continue our collective work to uphold them.</description>
